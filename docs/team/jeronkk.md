## ðŸ‘¤ Jeron (jeronkk)

**jeronkk** is a key developer of TutorProMax, the teamâ€™s desktop application built to support private tutors in managing their students, lessons, and scheduling tasks effectively. As a core team member, jeron contributed to both the applicationâ€™s backend design and user interface logic, playing a vital role in the implementation of core features.

During the course of the project, Jeron took the lead on developing key functionalities such as persistent lesson tracking, session timing logic, and command execution flow. They ensured that the logic behind commands like `add` and `clear` was both intuitive for users and well-integrated into the systemâ€™s existing model structure.

Jeron also contributed extensively to maintaining code quality through systematic testing. They implemented JUnit tests for both command and utility classes, which helped catch bugs early and ensured that the codebase remained stable and reliable across multiple releases.

In addition, Jeron improved the Developer Guide by documenting implementation details, command workflows, and contributing to UML diagrams that outlined key processes. Their contributions to both the technical and documentation aspects of the project helped maintain a cohesive and well-understood codebase throughout the team.
