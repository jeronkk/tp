## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/Math` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `‚Ä¶`‚Äã after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]‚Ä¶‚Äã` can be used as `¬†` (i.e. 0 times), `t/Math`, `t/Science t/English` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* However, there are 2 extensions from the `list` command.
    * `list` without any command behind will be treated as the basic list command where all contacts will be listed.
    * `list t/` will list all students with the particular tag (subject).
    * `list tt/` will list all students with tuition on a particular day.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

### Command History Navigation : arrow keys

Use the up (‚Üë) and down (‚Üì) arrow keys to navigate your previously entered commands.

* Pressing up (‚Üë) cycles backward through your command history.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install **TutorProMax** on the new computer.

- Run the app once to generate the necessary data folder.

- On your original computer, navigate to the folder:
`[TutorProMax]/data/addressbook.json`

- Copy the `addressbook.json` file (this contains your data) to a USB drive or cloud storage.

- On the new computer, go to the same directory:
`[TutorProMax]/data/`

- Replace the newly created `addressbook.json` with your copied version.

- Launch TutorProMax. Your previously saved contacts should now be visible.

<box type="info" seamless> **Tip:** If you're unsure where the data folder is located, it is usually in the installation directory where **TutorProMax** was unzipped or installed. You can also check `preferences.json` for the exact path. </box>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
